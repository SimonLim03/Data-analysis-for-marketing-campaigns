## Description
- A telecommunication company launched a marketing campaign to improve the adoption of 
their new subscription plan among customers. The telecommunication company has 
recorded various client’s information, including age, job, education, housing, loan, last 
contact duration, number of contacts performed before the campaign and consumer price 
index etc.
- In this regard, the main objective of the project is to build statistical learning models that 
can successfully identify the customer segments that are the most responsive to marketing 
campaigns. Furthermore, the project also aims at finding three effective business strategies
that can help the company in making decisions for their marketing campaigns. By achieving
those two goals, the company can gain a deeper understanding of their customers and 
launch a more effective campaigns, in order to promote the adoption of new subscription 
plan. 


## Results
- LightBGM models successfully 
predicted customer segments, who are the most likely to respond to marketing campaign 
- Bayesian estimation enabled to extract effective strategies for the campaign.
1. There was a 
strong negative correlation between employment variation rate and subscription behavior. 
That is, as the employment variation rate of clients is high, clients are less likely to respond 
to the campaign.
2. There was also a strong positive correlation 
between last contact duration and number of contacts and subscription behavior. It is 
suggested that if clients have had a number of contacts for considerable duration, they are
more likely to respond to a marketing campaign.
3. There was a strong positive 
correlation with EURIBOR-3 month., which is the average interest rate at which a selection 
of European banks lends funds to one another in the interbank market. Variations in this 
rate can considerably influence the customer’s responsiveness to the campaign. As this rate 
is high, clients are more likely to respond to the campaign.
